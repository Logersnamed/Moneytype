But we have active development team working on a new update 24/7.

## Shoutout

I will lift the veil of secrecy, the project was inpired by [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/). Also I took a word list from this site for a while.

## Instalation

1. Get latest release in Releases section.
2. Run installer.
2. Wait till this ugly green pop-up disappears.
3. Type.

## Contribution
To use [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We recommend that you use the latest LTS version available.

Clone the Moneytype repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/Logersnamed/Moneytype.git
```
To install prebuilt Electron binaries, use `npm`. The preferred method is to install Electron as a development dependency in your app:
```
npm install electron --save-dev
```
